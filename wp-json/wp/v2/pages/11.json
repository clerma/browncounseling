From a psychodynamic perspective, I look at past events and see how it ties into your life today. In this process, my goal is to collaborate with you to help gain the necessary coping skills to add to your tool belt of life.<\/p>\n<p>I specialize in helping couples or individuals overcome anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, life transitions, perfectionism, and relational issues. Also, for the last 5 years, I have specialized in helping clients focused on addiction or trauma come to a healthier place by aligning with the goals of the client.<\/p>\n<p>Therapy is a collaborative process. Taking the first step to schedule a session may be intimidating or create anxiety. I encourage you to reach out for a free consultation today.<\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"testimonial-author\"><p><strong style=\"color:#662500\">Devin Brown<\/strong><span>Founder - Brown Counseling &amp; Consulting, LLC<\/span><\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;I WANT TO GIVE ALL THANKS TO JESUS CHRIST&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:center|color:%23663200&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_transform=&#8221;text-uppercase&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][\/vc_section][vc_row disable_element=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;553&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1659032658693{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_section][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;STAFF&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:center|color:%23663200&#8243; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_transform=&#8221;text-uppercase&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&#8221;stretch_row&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1659031791478{background-color: #662500 !important;background-position: center !important;background-repeat: no-repeat !important;background-size: cover !important;}&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1659032880306{padding-right: 1px !important;}&#8221; el_class=&#8221;aa-1&#8243; offset=&#8221;vc_hidden-sm vc_hidden-xs&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;417&#8243; img_size=&#8221;450X730&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1660772740010{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243; offset=&#8221;vc_hidden-sm vc_hidden-xs&#8221;][vc_empty_space][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Devin Brown, LPC-S, LAC, NCC&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%23ffffff&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Founder of Brown Counseling&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h5|text_align:left|color:%23ffffff&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Licensed Professional Counselor-Supervisor&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%23ffffff&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text] Devin Brown is the Founder of Brown [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":653,"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11\/revisions\/653"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/browncounseling.biz\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
