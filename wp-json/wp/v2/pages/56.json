From traumatic events like divorce, death&#8230;etc, to subtle life events like a change in jobs or buying a home. I see therapy as a place to gain insight on bettering your quality of life. From a psychodynamic perspective, I look at past events and see how it ties into your life today. In this process, my goal is to collaborate with you to help gain the necessary coping skills to add to your tool belt of life.<\/div>\n<div id=\"statementParagraph2-en\" class=\"statementPara\">I specialize in helping couples or individuals overcome anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, life transitions, perfectionism, and relational issues. Also, for the last 5 years I have specialized in helping clients focused on addiction or trauma come to a healthier place by aligning with the goals of the client.<\/div>\n<div id=\"statementParagraph3-en\" class=\"statementPara\">Therapy is a collaborative process. Taking the first step to schedule a session may be intimidating or create anxiety.
