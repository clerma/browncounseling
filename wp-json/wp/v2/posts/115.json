That\u2019s right \u2013 they are among us. I often wonder how the non-social media folks decided not to jump on the bandwagon. Did they somehow know that SM would one day govern their lives and they just couldn\u2019t fathom such a travesty? Well, it may have been a conscious effort for some, but others may have had a different experience. It might have gone something like this: They came. They saw. They said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, this elite group (at least they are in my eyes) managed to outrun the trap. I know that \u201ctrap\u201d is an interesting choice for a word, especially when I, like many other creators, rely on social media for the kind of exposure that is needed to get the word out about our work.

So much so, that we can barely let a day go by without checking in. It starts with a notification. We hear that bell, and everything around us stops. Classical conditioning at its finest. Pavlov would be so proud. Before we open that app, we think to ourselves,<em>\u00a0let me check this right quick!<\/em>\u00a0And that usually leads to us mindlessly scrolling our timelines. Sometimes it\u2019s just for a moment \u2013 other times, we get caught up in a never-ending barrage of birthday wishes, anniversary shout outs, hearts, laughs, and thumbs ups[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]It may be hard to believe, but I know several people who do not have social media (SM) profiles.
