She chose peace over gold medals. She chose herself over others. That is the attitude that every human being needs to take. Some of you may be thinking,\u00a0<em>Isn\u2019t that a little selfish?<\/em>\u00a0The short answer is no. The more complex and detailed response is forthcoming, but to be direct \u2013 it is not selfish. It\u2019s called self-preservation.<\/p>\n<p>(<em>ESPN<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Too many times, I have seen people remain in places for far too long. They remain stagnant and feel a sense of obligation. Why? Because\u00a0<em>they<\/em>\u00a0will be upset, or\u00a0<em>they<\/em>\u00a0will end up in a bind, or\u00a0<em>they<\/em>\u00a0will suffer some other form of disappointment over their personal choice to bow out gracefully. Well, guess what?\u00a0<em>They<\/em>\u00a0will be alright.<\/p>\n<p>Who are\u00a0<em>they<\/em>? The ones who want you to forego your own wants and needs so you can fulfill theirs.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us have been erroneously taught to endure mistreatment and outright abuse at the hands of employers because being a \u201cgood\u201d employee represents loyalty and dependability. Especially when we have the kind of job that comes with a great deal of responsibility. The position may seem glamorous to those on the outside looking in. But only the people who are walking a mile in those shoes truly know how much they can take.<\/p>\n<p>The flack that Biles has received over her decision to withdraw from the Olympic finals is appalling. She has been called a \u201cquitter\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace to her country.\u201d Like many of you, the criticism made me angry. I\u2019m glad that she received such an outpouring of love and support from people (myself included) who understood her decision and respect her for it. \u00a0I sincerely hope that her decision inspired millions of people to follow her lead and protect their peace over people pleasing.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]imone Biles chose her mental health and well-being over the Olympic finals.
